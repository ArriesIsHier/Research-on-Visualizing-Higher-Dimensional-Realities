# Research-on-Visualizing-Higher-Dimensional-Realities
This repo explores the visualization of 4D objects, focusing on the tesseract or "hypercube." We employ mathematical models and Python-based graphics to project these 4D shapes into 3D space. Our aim is to understand the nature and limitations of representing higher-dimensional spaces within our 3D reality.
